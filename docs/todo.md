# Mycelium Chat - Current Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Completed: TF Connect Authentication

### What We Accomplished
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Successfully deployed to `https://chat.threefold.pro`
- **TF Connect Integration**: Fixed authentication flow with custom callback handling
- **CSP Issues Resolved**: Removed external script dependencies to avoid Content Security Policy blocks
- **Callback Processing**: Created simplified callback.html that processes TF Connect authentication without external libraries
- **Authentication Storage**: Implemented localStorage-based auth result storage for seamless login flow

### Technical Solutions Implemented
1. **Callback URL Fix**: Updated from `/src/callback.html` to `/callback.html` 
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Added fallback logic to find and copy callback.html from multiple locations
3. **CSP Compliance**: Removed external TF Connect library dependency, implemented direct parameter parsing
4. **Error Handling**: Eliminated `window.close()` errors and improved redirect flow
5. **Environment Variables**: Configured GitHub Secrets for domain and TF Connect settings

### Current Authentication Flow
```
1. User clicks "Login with ThreeFold Connect"
2. Redirects to TF Connect with proper app ID and callback URL
3. User authenticates in TF Connect app
4. TF Connect redirects to /callback.html with signedAttempt data
5. Callback extracts user profile (doubleName, email, avatar)
6. Profile stored in localStorage and redirects to main app
7. AuthProvider detects stored auth and completes login
```

## üéØ Next Priority: Verify TF Connect ID Integration

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Verify TF Connect ID in Chat Interface**
   - Confirm logged-in user's ThreeFold Connect ID is accessible in chat components
   - Check that profile data flows correctly from AuthProvider to ChatInterface
   - Ensure user identity is properly displayed in UI

2. **Implement User Discovery by TF Connect ID**
   - Add contact search functionality using ThreeFold Connect IDs
   - Create user lookup system (e.g., search for "idrnd.3bot")
   - Test finding and adding other TF Connect users as contacts

3. **Test Basic Chat Flow**
   - Verify authenticated user can send messages
   - Confirm user identity is attached to messages
   - Test contact management with TF Connect IDs

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] AuthProvider exposes current user's TF Connect profile
- [ ] ChatInterface displays logged-in user's doubleName/ID
- [ ] Contact search accepts TF Connect IDs as input
- [ ] Message sending includes sender's TF Connect identity
- [ ] User discovery works with format: `username.3bot`

## üîÑ Current Architecture Status

### Working Components
- ‚úÖ **Static Web Deployment**: GitHub Pages with custom domain
- ‚úÖ **TF Connect Authentication**: Full OAuth flow working
- ‚úÖ **React + ChatScope UI**: Modern chat interface ready
- ‚úÖ **Environment Configuration**: Production and development setups

### Integration Points to Verify
- üîç **AuthProvider ‚Üí ChatInterface**: User profile data flow
- üîç **Contact Discovery**: TF Connect ID search functionality  
- üîç **Message Identity**: Sender identification in chat messages
- ‚è≥ **Mycelium Backend**: HTTP API integration (localhost:8989)

## üìã Development Workflow

### Testing Authentication
```bash
# Test the live deployment
1. Go to https://chat.threefold.pro
2. Click "Login with ThreeFold Connect"
3. Complete authentication in TF Connect app
4. Verify successful login and profile display
5. Check browser console for stored auth data
```

### Next Development Steps
1. **Profile Verification**: Ensure TF Connect profile is accessible in React components
2. **Contact Search**: Implement search by TF Connect ID functionality
3. **User Discovery**: Test finding other users (e.g., search for known TF Connect IDs)
4. **Message Flow**: Verify authenticated messaging with proper sender identity
5. **Mycelium Integration**: Connect to local Mycelium daemon for P2P messaging

## üéâ Success Metrics

### Authentication Success ‚úÖ
- [x] TF Connect login completes without errors
- [x] User profile data is extracted and stored
- [x] Main app recognizes authenticated user
- [x] No CSP or callback URL issues

### Next Success Criteria
- [ ] Chat interface shows logged-in user's TF Connect ID
- [ ] Can search for and find other TF Connect users
- [ ] Basic chat functionality works with authenticated identity
- [ ] User discovery enables finding contacts by TF Connect ID

The foundation is solid - now we need to verify the authentication data flows correctly through the chat interface and implement user discovery by TF Connect ID.
