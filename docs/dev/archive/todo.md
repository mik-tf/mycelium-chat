# Mycelium Chat - Current Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Completed: TF Connect Authentication & User Discovery

### What We Accomplished
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Successfully deployed to `https://chat.threefold.pro`
- **TF Connect Integration**: Fixed authentication flow with custom callback handling
- **CSP Issues Resolved**: Removed external script dependencies to avoid Content Security Policy blocks
- **Callback Processing**: Created simplified callback.html that processes TF Connect authentication without external libraries
- **Authentication Storage**: Implemented localStorage-based auth result storage for seamless login flow
- **User Identity Display**: TF Connect ID properly shown in header menu (e.g., "TF Connect: idrnd.3bot")
- **Contact Search**: Implemented search by TF Connect ID format (`username.3bot`)
- **User Discovery**: Mock contact search and addition functionality working

### Technical Solutions Implemented
1. **Callback URL Fix**: Updated from `/src/callback.html` to `/callback.html` 
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Added fallback logic to find and copy callback.html from multiple locations
3. **CSP Compliance**: Removed external TF Connect library dependency, implemented direct parameter parsing
4. **Error Handling**: Eliminated `window.close()` errors and improved redirect flow
5. **Environment Variables**: Configured GitHub Secrets for domain and TF Connect settings
6. **Profile Integration**: TF Connect profile data flows through AuthProvider to all components
7. **Contact Management**: Search, add, and display contacts by TF Connect ID

### Current Authentication Flow ‚úÖ WORKING
```
1. User clicks "Login with ThreeFold Connect"
2. Redirects to TF Connect with proper app ID and callback URL
3. User authenticates in TF Connect app
4. TF Connect redirects to /callback.html with signedAttempt data
5. Callback extracts user profile (doubleName, email, avatar)
6. Profile stored in localStorage and redirects to main app
7. AuthProvider detects stored auth and completes login
8. Header displays TF Connect ID, contact search works
```

### Verified Working Features ‚úÖ
- [x] TF Connect login completes without errors
- [x] User profile data extracted and stored correctly
- [x] Main app recognizes authenticated user
- [x] TF Connect ID displayed in header menu
- [x] Contact search by TF Connect ID format works
- [x] Can add mock contacts and see TF Connect IDs
- [x] User identity flows through chat interface

## üö® Current Issue: Mycelium Connection

### Problem Identified
- **Local Mycelium Running**: User confirms Mycelium daemon is running and accessible via browser
- **Chat Website Shows Disconnected**: `https://chat.threefold.pro` shows "Mycelium Disconnected"
- **Incorrect Address Format**: Showing `2001:db8::23a9:59f3` (not a valid Mycelium address)
- **API Connection Issue**: Chat website cannot connect to `localhost:8989` from deployed site

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue is likely **CORS/Cross-Origin** - the deployed website at `https://chat.threefold.pro` cannot make HTTP requests to `localhost:8989` due to:
1. **Different Origins**: HTTPS site ‚Üí HTTP localhost
2. **Browser Security**: Blocks cross-origin requests to localhost
3. **No CORS Headers**: Mycelium daemon may not allow external origins

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Fix Mycelium Connection Issue** üö®
   - Investigate why `https://chat.threefold.pro` shows "Mycelium Disconnected"
   - Check CORS/cross-origin issues between HTTPS site and `localhost:8989`
   - Verify Mycelium HTTP API accessibility from deployed website
   - Fix incorrect Mycelium address format (`2001:db8::23a9:59f3`)

2. **Mycelium API Integration**
   - Test direct API calls to `localhost:8989` from browser
   - Check Mycelium daemon CORS configuration
   - Implement proper error handling for connection failures
   - Add fallback/offline mode for development

3. **Address Format Investigation**
   - Check what `2001:db8::23a9:59f3` represents (IPv6 test address?)
   - Get actual Mycelium address from running daemon
   - Update profile to show correct Mycelium network address

## üîÑ Current Architecture Status

### Working Components ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Static Web Deployment**: GitHub Pages with custom domain
- ‚úÖ **TF Connect Authentication**: Full OAuth flow working  
- ‚úÖ **User Identity & Discovery**: TF Connect ID display and contact search
- ‚úÖ **React + ChatScope UI**: Modern chat interface ready
- ‚úÖ **Environment Configuration**: Production and development setups

### Integration Points Needing Fix üö®
- üö® **Mycelium HTTP API**: Connection failing from deployed site to localhost:8989
- üö® **Address Resolution**: Incorrect Mycelium address format displayed
- ‚è≥ **P2P Messaging**: Depends on Mycelium API connection working
- üîç **AuthProvider ‚Üí ChatInterface**: User profile data flow
- üîç **Contact Discovery**: TF Connect ID search functionality  
- üîç **Message Identity**: Sender identification in chat messages
- ‚è≥ **Mycelium Backend**: HTTP API integration (localhost:8989)

## üìã Development Workflow

### Testing Authentication
```bash
# Test the live deployment
1. Go to https://chat.threefold.pro
2. Click "Login with ThreeFold Connect"
3. Complete authentication in TF Connect app
4. Verify successful login and profile display
5. Check browser console for stored auth data
```

### Next Development Steps
1. **Profile Verification**: Ensure TF Connect profile is accessible in React components
2. **Contact Search**: Implement search by TF Connect ID functionality
3. **User Discovery**: Test finding other users (e.g., search for known TF Connect IDs)
4. **Message Flow**: Verify authenticated messaging with proper sender identity
5. **Mycelium Integration**: Connect to local Mycelium daemon for P2P messaging

## üéâ Success Metrics

### Authentication Success ‚úÖ
- [x] TF Connect login completes without errors
- [x] User profile data is extracted and stored
- [x] Main app recognizes authenticated user
- [x] No CSP or callback URL issues

### Next Success Criteria
- [ ] Chat interface shows logged-in user's TF Connect ID
- [ ] Can search for and find other TF Connect users
- [ ] Basic chat functionality works with authenticated identity
- [ ] User discovery enables finding contacts by TF Connect ID

The foundation is solid - now we need to verify the authentication data flows correctly through the chat interface and implement user discovery by TF Connect ID.
