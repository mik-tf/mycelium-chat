# Development Status and Current Issues

## What We Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Docker Compose Setup
- Created working Docker Compose configuration with:
  - Matrix Synapse homeserver (SQLite backend)
  - Element web client
  - Mock bridge and discovery services
- Fixed networking issues using `network_mode: host` for Synapse
- Created custom `synapse-init.sh` initialization script

### ‚úÖ Matrix Homeserver Configuration
- Synapse container running successfully on port 8008
- Matrix API responding correctly (`/_matrix/client/versions`)
- Custom initialization script generates homeserver.yaml with registration settings
- Element web client accessible at http://localhost:8080

### ‚úÖ Container Management
- All containers start and run properly
- Synapse logs show successful startup
- Element serves web interface correctly
- Network connectivity between services working

## üö® Current Issue: Registration Still Disabled

**Problem**: Despite configuration attempts, user registration remains disabled in Element UI.

**Error Message**: "Registration has been disabled on this homeserver"

**What We Tried**:
1. Added `enable_registration: true` and `enable_registration_without_verification: true` to synapse-init.sh
2. Created custom homeserver.yaml with registration enabled
3. Used SYNAPSE_ENABLE_REGISTRATION environment variable
4. Manually edited homeserver.yaml inside running container
5. Restarted containers multiple times

**Current Configuration**:
- Using custom `synapse-init.sh` script with sed commands to enable registration
- Script modifies generated homeserver.yaml to set registration flags
- Container starts successfully but registration settings not taking effect

## Next Steps to Fix Registration

1. **Verify homeserver.yaml contents**: Check if sed commands in synapse-init.sh are actually modifying the config
2. **Check Synapse logs**: Look for registration-related errors or warnings
3. **Test Matrix API directly**: Use curl to test registration endpoint
4. **Alternative approach**: Create complete homeserver.yaml file instead of modifying generated one
5. **Permissions check**: Ensure container can write to config files

## Working Configuration Files

- `docker-compose.yml`: Synapse with network_mode: host, custom entrypoint
- `synapse-init.sh`: Custom initialization with registration enablement
- `element-config.json`: Element client pointing to localhost:8008

## Architecture Status

- Matrix Synapse: ‚úÖ Running (connectivity working)
- Element Web: ‚úÖ Running (UI accessible)
- Registration: ‚ùå Still disabled (core blocker)
- Bridge Service: üîÑ Mock implementation (needs real Rust service)
- Discovery Service: üîÑ Mock implementation (needs real Rust service)

The development environment is 90% functional - only registration enablement remains to be solved.
